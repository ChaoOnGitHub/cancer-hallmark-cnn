IL-15 is a pluripotent antiapoptotic cytokine that signals to cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system and is regarded as a highly promising immunomodulatory agent in cancer therapy . Sepsis is a lethal condition in which apoptosis-induced depletion of immune cells and subsequent immunosuppression are thought to contribute to morbidity and mortality . This study tested the ability of IL-15 to block apoptosis , prevent immunosuppression , and improve survival in sepsis . Mice were made septic using cecal ligation and puncture or Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia . The experiments comprised a 2 x 2 full factorial design with surgical sepsis versus sham and IL-15 versus vehicle . In addition to survival studies , splenic cellularity , canonical markers of activation and proliferation , intracellular pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein expression , and markers of immune cell apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry . Cytokine production was examined both in plasma of treated mice and splenocytes that were stimulated ex vivo . IL-15 blocked sepsis-induced apoptosis of NK cells , dendritic cells , and CD8 T cells . IL-15 also decreased sepsis-induced gut epithelial apoptosis . IL-15 therapy increased the abundance of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 while decreasing proapoptotic Bim and PUMA . IL-15 increased both circulating IFN-gamma , as well as the percentage of NK cells that produced IFN-gamma . Finally , IL-15 increased survival in both cecal ligation and puncture and P. aeruginosa pneumonia . In conclusion , IL-15 prevents two immunopathologic hallmarks of sepsis , namely , apoptosis and immunosuppression , and improves survival in two different models of sepsis . IL-15 represents a potentially novel therapy of this highly lethal disorder .
Mutations in the gene encoding cytosolic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase ( SOD1 ) have been linked to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( FALS ) . However the molecular mechanisms of motor neuron death are multi-factorial and remain unclear . Here we examined DNA damage , p53 activity and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells transfected to achieve low-level expression of either wild-type or mutant Gly(93)-->Ala ( G93A ) SOD1 , typical of FALS . DNA damage was investigated by evaluating the levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine ( 8-oxodGuo ) and DNA strand breaks . Significantly higher levels of DNA damage , increased p53 activity , and a greater percentage of apoptotic cells were observed in SH-SY5Y cells transfected with G93A SOD1 when compared to cells overexpressing wild-type SOD1 and untransfected cells . Western blot , FACS , and confocal microscopy analysis demonstrated that G93A SOD1 is present in the nucleus in association with DNA . Nuclear G93A SOD1 has identical superoxide dismutase activity but displays increased peroxidase activity when compared to wild-type SOD1 . These results indicate that the G93A mutant SOD1 association with DNA might induce DNA damage and trigger the apoptotic response by activating p53 . This toxic activity of mutant SOD1 in the nucleus may play an important role in the complex mechanisms associated with motor neuron death observed in ALS pathogenesis .
BACKGROUND Barrett's esophagus ( BE ) is caused by gastroesophageal reflux with consecutive mucosal inflammation , predisposing patients to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC ) . We investigated changes in T cell-related mucosal combinatorial molecular protein patterns in both diseases using the novel Multi-Epitope-Ligand-Cartography , a unique robotic whole-cell imaging technology that simultaneously visualizes dozens of proteins in structurally intact tissues and correlates cellular localization of proteins with function . RESULTS Biopsies were taken during endoscopy from BE , EAC , and normal control tissue , and proteomic microscopy was performed on 32 different epitopes . When the significance level was set to p < 0.0005 and the search depth to five antibody combinations , controls and BE can be differentiated by 63 , controls and EAC by 3222 , and BE from EAC by 1521 distinct protein combinations.For example , the number of activated apoptotic naive and memory T cells was significantly increased only in BE , whereas the number of activated apoptotic helper and regulatory T cells was significantly elevated in BE and EAC . In contrast , the number of activated apoptotic cytotoxic T cells was significantly elevated only in EAC . Confirming different pathways in BE and EAC , the number of T lymphocytes with p53 expression and downregulation of bcl2 expression ( CD3+p53+Bcl2-NfkB- ) was significantly increased in EAC compared to BE and controls . Interestingly , the number of precursor T cells ( CD7+ ) was significantly elevated only in EAC . These cells lack Bax and caspase-8 , suggesting impaired apoptosis in the early stages of T cell differentiation . CONCLUSION Proteomic analysis showed for the first time that proteins , which are critically involved in the mucosal immune system of the esophagus , are distinctly expressed in BE and EAC , whereas others are comparably altered in both diseases , suggesting that many pathogenic events might be shared by both diseases . Topological proteomic analysis , therefore , helps us to understand the different pathogenic events in the underlying disease pathways .
The multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib induced a variable but significant decrease of viability in both p53(wild-type) ( EHEB , JVM-2 , JVM-3 ) and p53(mutated) ( MEC-1 , MEC-2 , BJAB ) prolymphocytic B leukemic cells , due to a combination of cell cycle block in G1 and apoptosis . Antibody phospho-kinase array analysis revealed that dasatinib inhibited the phosphorylation of various kinases , including ERK1/2 and p38/MAPK as well as of STAT3 transcription factors , in both p53(wild-type) and p53(mutated) cells . Therefore , dasatinib might offer a novel therapeutic strategy not only for p53(wild-type) , but also for p53(mutated) B malignancies that have the worst prognosis and urgently need innovative therapeutic approaches .
SET and MYND domain-containing protein 3 ( SMYD3 ) is a histone methyltransferase that plays an important role in transcriptional regulation in human carcinogenesis . It can specifically methylate histone H3 at lysine 4 and activate the transcription of a set of downstream genes , including several oncogenes ( e.g. , N-myc , CrkL , Wnt10b , RIZ and hTERT ) and genes involved in the control of cell cycle ( e.g. , CyclinG1 and CDK2 ) and signal transduction ( e.g. , STAT1 , MAP3K11 and PIK3CB ) . To determine the effects of SMYD3 over-expression on cell proliferation , we transfected SMYD3 into MDA-MB-231 cells and found that these cells showed several transformed phenotypes as demonstrated by colony growth in soft agar . Besides , we show here that down-regulation of SMYD3 could induce G1-phase cell cycle arrest , indicating the potent induction of apoptosis by SMYD3 knockdown . These results suggest the regulatory mechanisms of SMYD3 on the acceleration of cell cycle and facilitate the development of strategies that may inhibit the progression of cell cycle in breast cancer cells .
Recently , we identified the " apoptotic ring, " containing phosphorylated histone H2AX ( gamma-H2AX ) , as an early chromatin modification during apoptosis . Because gamma-H2AX initiates the DNA damage response ( DDR ) , we tested whether the apoptotic H2AX response leads to the full recruitment of the DDR factors that normally coordinate DNA repair and cell-cycle checkpoints . We show that the apoptotic H2AX response does not recruit the DDR factors because MDC1 ( mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 ) , which normally binds to gamma-H2AX in response to DNA damage and amplifies the DDR , is cleaved by caspase-3 . This cleavage separates the BRCT and FHA domains of MDC1 and constitutes a novel mechanism for the inactivation of DNA repair in apoptotic cells . Also , we show that downregulation of MDC1 increases the apoptotic response to TRAIL . Together , these results implicate MDC1 in the cellular apoptotic response .
Isolinderanolide B ( IOB ) , a butanolide extracted from the stems of Cinnamomum subavenium , was investigated for its antiproliferative activity in T24 human bladder cancer cells . To identity the anticancer mechanism of IOB , its effect on apoptosis , cell cycle distribution , and levels of p53 , p21 Waf1/Cip1 , Fas/APO-1 receptor , and Fas ligand was assayed . Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the G0/G1 phase arrest is because of increase in the expression of p21 Waf1/Cip1 . An enhancement in Fas/APO-1 and membrane-bound Fas ligand ( mFasL ) might be responsible for the apoptotic effect induced by IOB . This study reports the novel finding that the induction of p21 Waf1/Cip1 and activity of the Fas/mFas ligand apoptotic system may participate in the antiproliferative activity of IOB in T24 cells .
By using the rat azoxymethane ( AOM)-induced colon carcinogenesis model , which mirrors many clinical features of human colorectal cancer , we examined whether genetic changes occurring early in colonic mucosa are predictive of treatment efficacy . In the present study the administration of the chemopreventive agent lupulone over the course of 7 weeks postinitiation reduced the number of preneoplastic lesions in the colonic mucosa by 50% . At the molecular level we observed the downregulation of genes involved in the inflammatory response , including IL-1beta and TNF-alpha , and of matrix metalloproteinase-7 gene and protein expression . We also observed a substantial upregulation of components of the innate immune system , alpha-defensin-5 and lipocalin 2 . Lupulone induced the expression of apoptosis-related genes and caused a reversal of the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 ( Bcl-2 ; antiapoptotic ) to Bcl-2 associated X protein ( Bax ; proapoptotic ) transcript and protein ratios ( Bcl-2/Bax > 1 in AOM controls and Bcl-2/Bax < 1 in lupulone-treated AOM rats ) . Here , we identify several target genes that could be considered early biomarkers of colon carcinogenesis and indicative of drug efficacy .
