The multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib induced a variable but significant decrease of viability in both p53(wild-type) ( EHEB , JVM-2 , JVM-3 ) and p53(mutated) ( MEC-1 , MEC-2 , BJAB ) prolymphocytic B leukemic cells , due to a combination of cell cycle block in G1 and apoptosis . Antibody phospho-kinase array analysis revealed that dasatinib inhibited the phosphorylation of various kinases , including ERK1/2 and p38/MAPK as well as of STAT3 transcription factors , in both p53(wild-type) and p53(mutated) cells . Therefore , dasatinib might offer a novel therapeutic strategy not only for p53(wild-type) , but also for p53(mutated) B malignancies that have the worst prognosis and urgently need innovative therapeutic approaches .
BACKGROUND Human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) has efficiently adapted to its host and establishes a persistent infection characterized by low levels of viral gene expression and slow proliferation of HTLV-I infected cells over decades . We have previously found that HTLV-I p30 is a negative regulator of virus expression . RESULTS In this study we show that p30 targets multiple cell cycle checkpoints resulting in a delayed entry into S phase . We found that p30 binds to cyclin E and CDK2 and prevents the formation of active cyclin E-CDK2 complexes . In turn , this decreases the phosphorylation levels of Rb and prevents the release of E2F and its transcriptional activation of genes required for G1/S transition . Our studies also show that HTLV-II p28 does not bind cyclin E and does not affect cell cycle progression . CONCLUSIONS In contrast to HTLV-I , the HTLV-II-related retrovirus is not oncogenic in humans . Here we report that the HTLV-I p30 delays cell cycle progression while its homologue , HTLV-II p28 , does not , providing evidence for important differences between these two related retrovirus proteins .
The role of estrogen receptor beta ( ERbeta ) in breast cancer is unclear . ERbeta is considered to have a protective role in breast cancer development based on findings demonstrating that ERbeta expression inhibits ERalpha-mediated proliferation of breast cancer cells . We previously demonstrated that ERbeta causes a ligand independent G2 cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 cells . To study the mechanisms of the ERbeta-mediated G2 cell cycle arrest , we investigated its effects on the regulatory pathways responsible for the G2/M phase transition . We found that ERbeta inhibits CDK1 activity , which is the critical determinant of the G2/M progression . CDK1 activity is modulated by both stimulatory and inhibitory factors . Cyclin B1 is the major activator of CDK1 . ERbeta inhibited the cell cycle-dependent stimulation of cyclin B1 mRNA and protein . GADD45A and BTG2 are two major inhibitors of CDK1 , which have been implicated in breast tumor formation . Based on these findings , we explored if the expression pattern of GADD45A and BTG2 is affected by ERbeta . We found that ERbeta stimulates GADD45A and BTG2 mRNA levels . The induction of these two genes is caused by ERbeta binding directly to these genes and recruiting c-jun and NCOA2 . Our findings demonstrated that unliganded ERbeta causes a G2 cell cycle arrest by inactivating CDK1 through the repression of cyclin B1 and stimulation of GADD45A and BTG2 expression . These results provide evidence that drugs that stimulate the production of unliganded ERbeta may be effective new therapies to prevent breast cancer .
Heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) is a molecular chaperone involved in folding and stabilizing multiple intracellular proteins that have roles in cell activation and proliferation . Many Hsp90 client proteins in tumor cells are mutated or overexpressed oncogenic proteins driving cancer cell growth , leading to the acceptance of Hsp90 as a potential therapeutic target for cancer . Because several signal transduction molecules that are dependent on Hsp90 function are also involved in activation of innate and adaptive cells of the immune system , we investigated the mechanism by which inhibiting Hsp90 leads to therapeutic efficacy in rodent models of inflammation and autoimmunity . EC144 , a synthetic Hsp90 inhibitor , blocked LPS-induced TLR4 signaling in RAW 264.7 cells by inhibiting activation of ERK1/2 , MEK1/2 , JNK , and p38 MAPK but not NF-kappaB . Ex vivo LPS-stimulated CD11b(+) peritoneal exudate cells from EC144-treated mice were blocked from phosphorylating tumor progression locus 2 , MEK1/2 , and ERK1/2 . Consequently , EC144-treated mice were resistant to LPS administration and had suppressed systemic TNF-alpha release . Inhibiting Hsp90 also blocked in vitro CD4(+) T cell proliferation in mouse and human MLRs . In vivo , semitherapeutic administration of EC144 blocked disease development in rat collagen-induced arthritis by suppressing the inflammatory response . In a mouse collagen-induced arthritis model , EC144 also suppressed disease development , which correlated with a suppressed Ag-specific Ab response and a block in activation of Ag-specific CD4(+) T cells . Our results describe mechanisms by which blocking Hsp90 function may be applicable to treatment of autoimmune diseases involving inflammation and activation of the adaptive immune response .
Cyclin-dependent kinases are most extensively studied targets for cancer chemotherapy since the tumor cells exhibit false checkpoints and can proliferate even if the genome is compromised . Cyclin-dependent kinases ensure the tight regulation of the cell cycle execution by mediating phosphorylation of cellular proteins . Deregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity by cellular and external factors leads to many diseases like cancers . Different methods like radiolabeled , fluorescence and luminescence are available for screening of library of compounds against kinases . However , bioluminescent methods offer several advantages like low background and no effect of fluorescent compound interference . Present study is focused on development , optimization and validation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 assay which is suitable for identification potent and selective , ATP competitive and non-competitive inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 . The aim of present investigation was to optimize the assay for cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cylin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin E with use of bioluminescence based biochemical reaction . Both cyclin-dependent kinase 2 which are cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin E complexes , have different affinity for ATP . Therefore , both isoform analogs of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 were optimized separately . Optimum cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin E concentration were found to be 250 ng/well and 200 ng/well , respectively . Optimum substrate ( histone H1 ) concentration was found to be 2.5 mg/ml for both cyclin-dependent kinase 2 analogs . Optimum reaction time was found to be 20 min for both cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin complexes .
