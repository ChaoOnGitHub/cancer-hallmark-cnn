IL-15 is a pluripotent antiapoptotic cytokine that signals to cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system and is regarded as a highly promising immunomodulatory agent in cancer therapy . Sepsis is a lethal condition in which apoptosis-induced depletion of immune cells and subsequent immunosuppression are thought to contribute to morbidity and mortality . This study tested the ability of IL-15 to block apoptosis , prevent immunosuppression , and improve survival in sepsis . Mice were made septic using cecal ligation and puncture or Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia . The experiments comprised a 2 x 2 full factorial design with surgical sepsis versus sham and IL-15 versus vehicle . In addition to survival studies , splenic cellularity , canonical markers of activation and proliferation , intracellular pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein expression , and markers of immune cell apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry . Cytokine production was examined both in plasma of treated mice and splenocytes that were stimulated ex vivo . IL-15 blocked sepsis-induced apoptosis of NK cells , dendritic cells , and CD8 T cells . IL-15 also decreased sepsis-induced gut epithelial apoptosis . IL-15 therapy increased the abundance of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 while decreasing proapoptotic Bim and PUMA . IL-15 increased both circulating IFN-gamma , as well as the percentage of NK cells that produced IFN-gamma . Finally , IL-15 increased survival in both cecal ligation and puncture and P. aeruginosa pneumonia . In conclusion , IL-15 prevents two immunopathologic hallmarks of sepsis , namely , apoptosis and immunosuppression , and improves survival in two different models of sepsis . IL-15 represents a potentially novel therapy of this highly lethal disorder .
Candida albicans infections are very frequent in cancer patients , whose immune system is often compromised , but whether this fungal pathogen affects cancer progression is unknown . C. albicans infection involves endogenous production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) and interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) . Increased levels of these cytokines have already been correlated with metastasis of most common cancer types . In this study , a well-established model of IL-18-dependent hepatic melanoma metastasis was used to study whether C. albicans can alter the ability of murine B16 melanoma ( B16M ) cells to colonize the liver . First , we determined the ability of intrasplenically ( IS ) injected B16M cells to metastasize into the liver of mice challenged with 5 x 10(4) C. albicans cells by three different routes ( intravenous , IV ; intrasplenic , IS ; or intraperitoneal , IP ) 12 h prior to injection of B16M cells . We demonstrated that C. albicans significantly increased metastasis of B16M cells with all three fungal injection routes . Pro-metastatic effects occurred when hepatic colonization with B16M cells place after the peak of TNF-alpha and IL-18 levels had been reached in the hepatic blood of fungal challenged mice . In a second set of experiments , mice were fungal challenged 4 days after injection of B16M cells . In these mice , C. albicans also potentiated the growth of established micro-metastases . Significantly , the fungal challenge had pro-metastatic effects without the C. albicans being able to reach the liver , suggesting that soluble factors can promote metastasis in remote sites . Mouse treatment with antifungal ketoconazol abrogated hepatic TNF-alpha stimulation by C. albicans and prevented the enhancement of hepatic metastasis in fungal challenged-mice . Therefore , the pro-inflammatory microenvironment generated by the host's systemic response to C. albicans stimulates circulating cancer cells to metastasize in the liver .
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) are widely distributed immunotoxic and carcinogenic environmental contaminants , known to affect macrophages . In order to identify their molecular targets in such cells , we have analyzed gene expression profile of primary human macrophages treated by the prototypical PAH benzo(a)pyrene ( BaP ) , using pangenomic oligonucleotides microarrays . Exposure of macrophages to BaP for 8 and 24 h resulted in 96 and 1100 genes , differentially expressed by at least a twofold change factor , respectively . Some of these targets , including the chemokine receptor CXCR5 , the G protein-coupled receptor 35 ( GPR35 ) , and the Ras regulator RASAL1 , have not been previously shown to be affected by PAHs , in contrast to others , such as interleukin-1beta and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) repressor . These BaP-mediated gene regulations were fully validated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays for some selected genes . Their bioinformatic analysis indicated that biological functions linked to immunity , inflammation , and cell death were among the most affected by BaP in human macrophages and that the AhR and p53 signaling pathways were the most significant canonical pathways activated by the PAH . AhR and p53 implications were moreover fully confirmed by the prevention of BaP-related upregulation of some selected target genes by AhR silencing or the use of pifithrin-alpha , an inhibitor of PAH bioactivation-related DNA damage/p53 pathways . Overall , these data , through identifying genes and signaling pathways targeted by PAHs in human macrophages , may contribute to better understand the molecular basis of the immunotoxicity of these environmental contaminants .
Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) is a high molecular weight protein serine/threonine kinase that plays a central role in the maintenance of genomic integrity by activating cell cycle checkpoints and promoting repair of DNA double-strand breaks . Little is known about the regulatory mechanisms for ATM expression itself . MicroRNAs are naturally existing regulators that modulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner . Here , we show that a human microRNA , miR-421 , suppresses ATM expression by targeting the 3'-untranslated region ( 3'UTR ) of ATM transcripts . Ectopic expression of miR-421 resulted in S-phase cell cycle checkpoint changes and an increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation , creating a cellular phenotype similar to that of cells derived from ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) patients . Blocking the interaction between miR-421 and ATM 3'UTR with an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide rescued the defective phenotype caused by miR-421 overexpression , indicating that ATM mediates the effect of miR-421 on cell cycle checkpoint and radiosensitivity . Overexpression of the N-Myc transcription factor , an oncogene frequently amplified in neuroblastoma , induced miR-421 expression , which , in turn , down-regulated ATM expression , establishing a linear signaling pathway that may contribute to N-Myc-induced tumorigenesis in neuroblastoma . Taken together , our findings implicate a previously undescribed regulatory mechanism for ATM expression and ATM-dependent DNA damage response and provide several potential targets for treating neuroblastoma and perhaps A-T .
DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) trigger ATM ( ataxia telangiectasia mutated ) signalling and elicit genomic rearrangements and chromosomal fragmentation if misrepaired or unrepaired . Although most DSB repair is ATM-independent , approximately 15% of ionizing radiation ( IR)-induced breaks persist in the absence of ATM-signalling. 53BP1 ( p53-binding protein 1 ) facilitates ATM-dependent DSB repair but is largely dispensable for ATM activation or checkpoint arrest . ATM promotes DSB repair within heterochromatin by phosphorylating KAP-1 ( KRAB-associated protein 1 , also known as TIF1beta , TRIM28 or KRIP-1 ; ref. 2 ) . Here , we show that the ATM signalling mediator proteins MDC1 , RNF8 , RNF168 and 53BP1 are also required for heterochromatic DSB repair . Although KAP-1 phosphorylation is critical for 53BP1-mediated repair , overall phosphorylated KAP-1 ( pKAP-1 ) levels are only modestly affected by 53BP1 loss. pKAP-1 is transiently pan-nuclear but also forms foci overlapping with gammaH2AX in heterochromatin . Cells that do not form 53BP1 foci , including human RIDDLE ( radiosensitivity , immunodeficiency , dysmorphic features and learning difficulties ) syndrome cells , fail to form pKAP-1 foci. 53BP1 amplifies Mre11-NBS1 accumulation at late-repairing DSBs , concentrating active ATM and leading to robust , localized pKAP-1 . We propose that ionizing-radiation induced foci ( IRIF ) spatially concentrate ATM activity to promote localized alterations in regions of chromatin otherwise inhibitory to repair .
Diets rich in fruits and vegetables are associated with lower risk of cancer which may be conferred in part by the antioxidant properties of these foods . However , antioxidant supplementation or increased consumption of antioxidant-rich foods has been reported to have inconsistent effects on DNA damage . The present work ( the DART study ) investigated the extent of inter-individual variation in DNA damage , the capacity for base excision repair ( BER ) and the responses of both variables to supplementation with an antioxidant supplement for 6 weeks . There was a wide inter-individual variation in endogenous lymphocyte DNA strand breaks ( 8-fold variation ) , in damage after a challenge with H2O2 ( 16-fold variation ) and in DNA repair ( 41-fold variation ) measured using the comet assay . When stratified into tertiles according to the pre-supplementation level of endogenous DNA damage , there was a statistically significant decrease in DNA damage after supplementation in the tertile with the highest pre-supplementation level of damage . There was no effect of supplementation on BER . Endogenous DNA damage level before supplementation was significantly different ( P = 0.037 ) between the three genotypes for the Val16Ala single nucleotide polymorphism in manganese superoxide dismutase ( rs4880 ) with individuals homozygous/wild type showing less damage than those carrying the alanine variant .
PURPOSE Genomic complexity is present in approximately 15% to 30% of all chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) and has emerged as a strong independent predictor of rapid disease progression and short remission duration in CLL . We conducted this study to advance our understanding of the causes of genomic complexity in CLL . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN We have obtained quantitative measurements of radiation-induced apoptosis and radiation-induced ATM autophosphorylation in purified CLL cells from 158 and 140 patients , respectively , and have used multivariate analysis to identify independent contributions of various biological variables on genomic complexity in CLL . RESULTS Here , we identify a strong independent effect of radiation resistance on elevated genomic complexity in CLL and describe radiation resistance as a predictor for shortened CLL survival . Furthermore , using multivariate analysis , we identify del17p/p53 aberrations , del11q , del13q14 type II ( invariably resulting in Rb loss ) , and CD38 expression as independent predictors of genomic complexity in CLL , with aberrant p53 as a predictor of approximately 50% of genomic complexity in CLL . Focusing on del11q , we determined that normalized ATM activity was a modest predictor of genomic complexity but was not independent of del11q . Through single nucleotide polymorphism array-based fine mapping of del11q , we identified frequent monoallelic loss of Mre11 and H2AFX in addition to ATM , indicative of compound del11q-resident gene defects in the DNA double-strand break response . CONCLUSIONS Our quantitative analysis links multiple molecular defects , including for the first time del11q and large 13q14 deletions ( type II ) , to elevated genomic complexity in CLL , thereby suggesting mechanisms for the observed clinical aggressiveness of CLL in patients with unstable genomes .
Acute endothelial cell apoptosis and microvascular compromise couple gastrointestinal tract irradiation to reproductive death of intestinal crypt stem cell clonogens ( SCCs ) following high-dose radiation . Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of endothelial apoptosis prevents intestinal damage , but as the radiation dose is escalated , SCCs become directly susceptible to an alternate cell death mechanism , mediated via ceramide synthase ( CS)-stimulated de novo synthesis of the proapoptotic sphingolipid ceramide , and p53-independent apoptosis of crypt SCCs . We previously reported that ataxia-telangiectasia mutated deficiency resets the primary radiation lethal pathway , allowing CS-mediated apoptosis at the low-dose range of radiation . The mechanism for this event , termed target reordering , remains unknown . Here , we show that inactivation of DNA damage repair pathways signals CS-mediated apoptosis in crypt SCCs , presumably via persistent unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) . Genetic loss of function of sensors and transducers of DNA DSB repair confers the CS-mediated lethal pathway in intestines of sv129/B6Mre11(ATLD1/ATLD1) and C57BL/6(Prkdc/SCID) ( severe combined immunodeficient ) mice exposed to low-dose radiation . In contrast , CS-mediated SCC lethality was mitigated in irradiated gain-of-function Rad50(s/s) mice , and epistasis studies order Rad50 upstream of Mre11 . These studies suggest unrepaired DNA DSBs as causative in target reordering in intestinal SCCs . As such , we provide an in vivo model of DNA damage repair that is standardized , can be exploited to understand allele-specific regulation in intact tissue , and is pharmacologically tractable .
BACKGROUND Folate ( vitamin B9 ) is essential for cellular proliferation as it is involved in the biosynthesis of deoxythymidine monophosphate ( dTMP ) and s-adenosylmethionine ( AdoMet ) . The link between folate depletion and the genesis and progression of cancers of epithelial origin is of high clinical relevance , but still unclear . We recently demonstrated that sensitivity to low folate availability is affected by the rate of polyamine biosynthesis , which is prominent in prostate cells . We , therefore , hypothesized that prostate cells might be highly susceptible to genetic , epigenetic and phenotypic changes consequent to folate restriction . RESULTS We studied the consequences of long-term , mild folate depletion in a model comprised of three syngenic cell lines derived from the transgenic adenoma of the mouse prostate ( TRAMP ) model , recapitulating different stages of prostate cancer ; benign , transformed and metastatic . High-performance liquid chromatography analysis demonstrated that mild folate depletion ( 100 nM ) sufficed to induce imbalance in both the nucleotide and AdoMet pools in all prostate cell lines . Random oligonucleotide-primed synthesis ( ROPS ) revealed a significant increase in uracil misincorporation and DNA single strand breaks , while spectral karyotype analysis ( SKY ) identified five novel chromosomal rearrangements in cells grown with mild folate depletion . Using global approaches , we identified an increase in CpG island and histone methylation upon folate depletion despite unchanged levels of total 5-methylcytosine , indicating a broad effect of folate depletion on epigenetic regulation . These genomic changes coincided with phenotype changes in the prostate cells including increased anchorage-independent growth and reduced sensitivity to folate depletion . CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that prostate cells are highly susceptible to genetic and epigenetic changes consequent to mild folate depletion as compared to cells grown with supraphysiological amounts of folate ( 2 microM ) routinely used in tissue culture . In addition , we elucidate for the first time the contribution of these aspects to consequent phenotype changes in epithelial cells . These results provide a strong rationale for studying the effects of folate manipulation on the prostate in vivo , where cells might be more sensitive to changes in folate status resulting from folate supplementation or antifolate therapeutic approaches .
Epidemiological studies exploring the connection between hypertension and cancer incidence find a higher cancer mortality in hypertensive patients , particularly elevated in hypertension associated with a stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system . Primary aldosteronism , with plasma aldosterone levels between 0.5 and 1 nM ( 18-36 ng/dL ) and local aldosterone levels up to 500 nM ( 18,000 ng/dL ) , is now recognised as a more common cause for hypertension . We recently found angiotensin II to be genotoxic due to its induction of oxidative stress . Since aldosterone in higher concentrations also has oxidative effects , its potential genotoxic action in pig LLC-PK1 cells with properties of proximal tubules was analysed . DNA damage was evaluated by two test systems : the comet assay , and the micronucleus frequency test . The results showed that aldosterone concentrations starting from 10 nM ( 360 ng/dL ) caused a significant increase of DNA damage monitored with the comet assay in LLC-PK1 , while there was no change in cell vitality and proliferation . The micronucleus frequency test revealed that 10 nM aldosterone also leads to the formation of micronuclei . Furthermore , the formation of superoxide radicals in the cells by this aldosterone concentration could be detected with the superoxide-specific stain dihydroethidium . Further evidence for oxidative stress-induced DNA damage was its reversibility by the antioxidants tempol and catalase . Addition of the steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone or the novel selective nonsteroidal antagonist ( R)-BR-4628 reduced the DNA damage and the amount of superoxide radicals indicating a receptor-dependent process .
Mutations in the gene encoding cytosolic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase ( SOD1 ) have been linked to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( FALS ) . However the molecular mechanisms of motor neuron death are multi-factorial and remain unclear . Here we examined DNA damage , p53 activity and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells transfected to achieve low-level expression of either wild-type or mutant Gly(93)-->Ala ( G93A ) SOD1 , typical of FALS . DNA damage was investigated by evaluating the levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine ( 8-oxodGuo ) and DNA strand breaks . Significantly higher levels of DNA damage , increased p53 activity , and a greater percentage of apoptotic cells were observed in SH-SY5Y cells transfected with G93A SOD1 when compared to cells overexpressing wild-type SOD1 and untransfected cells . Western blot , FACS , and confocal microscopy analysis demonstrated that G93A SOD1 is present in the nucleus in association with DNA . Nuclear G93A SOD1 has identical superoxide dismutase activity but displays increased peroxidase activity when compared to wild-type SOD1 . These results indicate that the G93A mutant SOD1 association with DNA might induce DNA damage and trigger the apoptotic response by activating p53 . This toxic activity of mutant SOD1 in the nucleus may play an important role in the complex mechanisms associated with motor neuron death observed in ALS pathogenesis .
Recently , the use of gold nanoparticles as potential tumor selective radiosensitizers has been proposed as a breakthrough in radiotherapy . Experiments in living cells and in vivo have demonstrated the efficiency of the metal nanoparticles when combined with low energy x-ray radiations ( below conventional 1 MeV Linac radiation ) . Further studies on DNA have been performed in order to better understand the fundamental processes of sensitization and to further improve the method . In this work , we propose a new strategy based on the combination of platinum nanoparticles with irradiation by fast ions effectively used in hadron therapy . It is observed in particular that nanoparticles enhance strongly lethal damage in DNA , with an efficiency factor close to 2 for double strand breaks . In order to disentangle the effect of the nano-design architecture , a comparison with the effects of dispersed metal atoms at the same concentration has been performed . It is thus shown that the sensitization in nanoparticles is enhanced due to auto-amplified electronic cascades inside the nanoparticles , which reinforces the energy deposition in the close vicinity of the metal . Finally , the combination of fast ion radiation ( hadron therapy ) with platinum nanoparticles should strongly improve cancer therapy protocols .
In eukaryotic cells , multiple DNA repair mechanisms respond to a wide variety of DNA lesions . Homologous recombination-dependent repair provides a pathway for dealing with DNA double-strand breaks and replication fork demise . A key step in this process is the resolution of recombination intermediates such as Holliday junctions ( HJs ) . Recently , nucleases from yeast ( Yen1 ) and human cells ( GEN1 ) were identified that can resolve HJ intermediates , in a manner analogous to the E. coli HJ resolvase RuvC . Here , we have analyzed the role of Yen1 in DNA repair in S. cerevisiae , and show that while yen1Delta mutants are repair-proficient , yen1Delta mus81Delta double mutants are exquisitely sensitive to a variety of DNA-damaging agents that disturb replication fork progression . This phenotype is dependent upon RAD52 , indicating that toxic recombination intermediates accumulate in the absence of Yen1 and Mus81 . After MMS treatment , yen1Delta mus81Delta double mutants arrest with a G2 DNA content and unsegregated chromosomes . These findings indicate that Yen1 can act upon recombination/repair intermediates that arise in MUS81-defective cells following replication fork damage .
BRIT1 protein ( also known as MCPH1 ) contains 3 BRCT domains which are conserved in BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and other important molecules involved in DNA damage signaling , DNA repair , and tumor suppression . BRIT1 mutations or aberrant expression are found in primary microcephaly patients as well as in cancer patients . Recent in vitro studies suggest that BRIT1/MCPH1 functions as a novel key regulator in the DNA damage response pathways . To investigate its physiological role and dissect the underlying mechanisms , we generated BRIT1(-/-) mice and identified its essential roles in mitotic and meiotic recombination DNA repair and in maintaining genomic stability . Both BRIT1(-/-) mice and mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) were hypersensitive to gamma-irradiation . BRIT1(-/-) MEFs and T lymphocytes exhibited severe chromatid breaks and reduced RAD51 foci formation after irradiation . Notably , BRIT1(-/-) mice were infertile and meiotic homologous recombination was impaired . BRIT1-deficient spermatocytes exhibited a failure of chromosomal synapsis , and meiosis was arrested at late zygotene of prophase I accompanied by apoptosis . In mutant spermatocytes , DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) were formed , but localization of RAD51 or BRCA2 to meiotic chromosomes was severely impaired . In addition , we found that BRIT1 could bind to RAD51/BRCA2 complexes and that , in the absence of BRIT1 , recruitment of RAD51 and BRCA2 to chromatin was reduced while their protein levels were not altered , indicating that BRIT1 is involved in mediating recruitment of RAD51/BRCA2 to the damage site . Collectively , our BRIT1-null mouse model demonstrates that BRIT1 is essential for maintaining genomic stability in vivo to protect the hosts from both programmed and irradiation-induced DNA damages , and its depletion causes a failure in both mitotic and meiotic recombination DNA repair via impairing RAD51/BRCA2's function and as a result leads to infertility and genomic instability in mice .
We investigated the mechanisms of DNA exit during single-cell gel electrophoresis ( the comet assay ) by measuring the kinetics of the comet tail formation . In the neutral comet assay , the rate of DNA exit was found to be dependent on the topological state of DNA , which was influenced by either ethidium bromide or a low radiation dose . The results clearly show that the comet tail is formed by extended DNA loops : the loop extension , being reversible when the DNA torsional constraint remains in the loops , is favored when the constraint is relaxed . The kinetics of the comet formation in the case of a high radiation dose points out that accumulation of the single-strand breaks causes DNA fragmentation . In contrast to the neutral comet assay , the alkaline comet assay is not related to the chromatin loops . Our results imply that the alkaline treatment induces detachment of the loops from the nuclear matrix , and the comet tail is formed by ssDNA fragments , the ends of which are pulled out from the comet head by electric force . We suggest that the kinetic approach can be considered as an important improvement of the comet assay .
Although the immunomodulatory effects of many herbs have been extensively studied , research related to possible immunomodulatory effects of various spices is relatively scarce . Here , the potential immunomodulatory effects of black pepper and cardamom are investigated . Our data show that black pepper and cardamom aqueous extracts significantly enhance splenocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent , synergistic fashion . Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments reveal that black pepper and cardamom significantly enhance and suppress , respectively , T helper ( Th)1 cytokine release by splenocytes . Conversely , Th2 cytokine release by splenocytes is significantly suppressed and enhanced by black pepper and cardamom , respectively . Experimental evidence suggests that black pepper and cardamom extracts exert pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory roles , respectively . Consistently , nitric oxide production by macrophages is significantly augmented and reduced by black pepper and cardamom , respectively . Remarkably , it is evident that black pepper and cardamom extracts significantly enhance the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells , indicating their potential anti-cancer effects . Our findings strongly suggest that black pepper and cardamom exert immunomodulatory roles and antitumor activities , and hence they manifest themselves as natural agents that can promote the maintenance of a healthy immune system . We anticipate that black pepper and cardamom constituents can be used as potential therapeutic tools to regulate inflammatory responses and prevent/attenuate carcinogenesis .
Chronic inflammation , increased reactivity to self-antigens and incidences of cancer are hallmarks of aging . However , the underlying mechanisms are not well understood . Age-associated alterations in the DNA either due to oxidative damage , defects in DNA repair or epigenetic modifications such as methylation that lead to mutations and changes in the expression of genes are thought to be partially responsible . Here we report that epigenetic modifications in aged DNA also increase its immunogenicity rendering it more reactive to innate immune system cells such as the dendritic cells . We observed increased upregulation of costimulatory molecules as well as enhanced secretion of IFN-alpha from dendritic cells in response to DNA from aged donors as compared to DNA from young donors when it was delivered intracellularly via Lipofectamine . Investigations into the mechanisms revealed that DNA from aged subjects is not degraded , neither is it more damaged compared to DNA from young subjects . However , there is significantly decreased global level of methylation suggesting that age-associated hypomethylation of the DNA may be the cause of its increased immunogenicity . Increased immunogenicity of self DNA may thus be another mechanism that may contribute to the increase in age-associated chronic inflammation , autoimmunity and cancer .
Polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) are ubiquitous contaminants in the marine environment . Their toxicity is mainly linked to the ability of marine species to biotransform them into reactive metabolites . PAHs are thus often detected at trace levels in animal tissues . For biomonitoring purposes , this findings have two main consequences , ( i ) the determination of the PAH tissue concentration is not suitable for the evaluation of individual exposure to PAHs ( ii ) it can explain sometimes the lack of correlations obtained with relevant markers of toxicity such as genotoxicity biomarkers . The aim of the present study was to better investigate the link between PAH exposure and genotoxicity in marine flatfish . During a laboratory experiment , juvenile soles were exposed for four weeks to a mixture of three PAHs , namely benzo[a]pyrene , fluoranthene and pyrene , followed by one week of depuration . Fish were exposed via the trophic route to a daily PAH concentration of 120 mug/g food . Fish were sampled at different time points . The bioavailability and the biotransformation of PAHs were assessed by the measurement of biliary metabolites using a sensitive UPLC MS/MS method . The 7-ethoxyresorufine-O-deethylase was also measured in liver subcellular fractions as a biomarker of phase I biotransformation activities . Genotoxicity was assessed in parallel by the measurement of DNA strand breaks in fish erythrocytes by the alkaline comet assay . During this study , the high amount of PAH metabolites produced in sole demonstrated the bioavailability of PAHs and their biotransformation by fish enzymes . A positive correlation was observed between the level of hydroxylated PAH metabolites and genotoxicity as measured by the alkaline comet assay .
Oxazaphosphorines are a class of DNA alkylating agents . The aim of the present study was to compare the possible influence of three new generation oxazaphosphorines , D-17272 ( mafosfamide cyclohexylamine salt ) , D-18864 ( 4-hydro-peroxy-cyclophosphamide ) , and D-19575 ( glufosfamide , beta-D-glucose-isophosphoramide mustard ) on DNA damage induction in the human histiocytic lymphoma U937 cells . The flow cytometry APO-BRDU assay , based on the TUNEL method , was used for the in situ detection of DNA strand breaks . After exposure of U937 cells to the oxazaphosphorines , the patterns of temporary changes in the frequency of TUNEL positive U937 cells , expressing DNA breakage , were determined . The effects of the oxazaphosphorines on U937 cells were dependent on the agent tested and its dose , and the time intervals after the drug application . The different potential of D-17272 , D-18864 and D-19575 to induce DNA strand breakage in the human histiocytic lymphoma U937 cells was shown .
Squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) is the most frequent cancer in organ transplant recipients ( OTRs ) . The immune system plays a major role in the fight against SCC , however , little is known about the local inflammatory response in SCC at all . We analyzed quantity and quality of the perineoplastic inflammatory SCC microenvironment in immunocompetent patients and immmunosuppressed OTRs . RNA expression profile of SCC patients was analyzed for 8 different sets of genes relating to Th1 versus Th2 response using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis . SCC from immunocompetent patients and OTRs were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reactions for CD4 , CD8 , TBET , GATA-3 , FOXP3 , RORC , IFN-gamma , IL-4 , TGF-beta , IL-10 , and IL-17A mRNA expression . Immunohistochemistry was carried out in SCC for CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , and FOXP3 expression . Considerable inflammation was seen in both patient groups . SCC in immunocompetent patients and OTRs was associated with a mixed Th1 and Th2 gene expression signature . CD4(+) mRNA was diminished in immunosuppression . Skin adjacent to SCC in OTRs showed Th2 expression pattern as compared with immunocompetent patients . T-BET and IFN-gamma mRNA expression were decreased in the OTR group . Although Th17-weighted inflammation was unchanged , IL-17A mRNA level was markedly decreased with immunosuppression . Regulatory T cells , characterized by FOX-P3 and TGF-beta mRNA level , were decreased in OTRs . Our findings support the hypothesis that nontumor-bearing skin adjacent to SCC in OTRs is not necessarily normal and that the local microenvironment may contribute to a field effect contributing to higher recurrence rates and more aggressive behavior observed in these patients .
Regulation of adaptive immunity by innate immune cells is widely accepted . Conversely , adaptive immune cells can also regulate cells of the innate immune system . Here , we report for the first time the essential role of B cells in regulating macrophage ( Mphi ) phenotype . In vitro B cell/Mphi co-culture experiments together with experiments in transgenic mice models for B-cell deficiency or overexpression showed B1 cells to polarize Mphi to a distinct phenotype . This was characterized by downregulated TNF-alpha , IL-1beta and CCL3 , but upregulated IL-10 upon LPS stimulation ; constitutive expression of M2 Mphi markers ( e.g . Ym1 , Fizz1 ) and overexpression of TRIF-dependent cytokines ( IFN-beta , CCL5 ) . Mechanistically , this phenotype was linked to a defective NF-kappaB activation , but a functional TRIF/STAT1 pathway . B1-cell-derived IL-10 was found to be instrumental in the polarization of these Mphi . Finally , in vivo relevance of B1-cell-induced Mphi polarization was confirmed using the B16 melanoma tumor model where adoptive transfer of B1 cells induced an M2 polarization of tumor-associated Mphi . Collectively , our results define a new mechanism of Mphi polarization wherein B1 cells play a key role in driving Mphi to a unique , but M2-biased phenotype . Future studies along these lines may lead to targeting of B1 cells to regulate Mphi response in inflammation and cancer .
BACKGROUND The immune system plays an important role in the multifactorial biologic system during the development of neoplasias . However , the involvement of the inflammatory response in the promotion/control of malignant cells is still controversial , and the cell subsets and the mechanisms involved are poorly investigated . The goal of this study was to characterize the clinical-pathological status and the immunophenotyping profile of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and their association with the animal survival rates in canine mammary carcinomas . METHODS Fifty-one animals with mammary carcinomas , classified as carcinomas in mixed tumors-MC-BMT = 31 and carcinomas-MC = 20 were submitted to systematic clinical-pathological analysis ( tumor size ; presence of lymph node and pulmonary metastasis ; clinical stage ; histological grade ; inflammatory distribution and intensity as well as the lymphocytic infiltrate intensity ) and survival rates . Twenty-four animals ( MC-BMT = 16 and MC = 8 ) were elected to the immunophenotypic study performed by flow cytometry . RESULTS Data analysis demonstrated that clinical stage II-IV and histological grade was I more frequent in MC-BMT as compared to MC . Univariate analysis demonstrated that the intensity of inflammation ( moderate/intense ) and the proportion of CD4+ ( > or = 66.7% ) or CD8+ T-cells ( <33.3% ) were not associated with worse survival rate . Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only lymphocytic infiltrate intensity > or = 600 ( P = 0.02 ) remained as independent prognostic factor . Despite the clinical manifestation , the lymphocytes represented the predominant cell type in the tumor infiltrate . The percentage of T-cells was higher in animals with MC-BMT without metastasis , while the percentage of B-lymphocytes was greater in animals with metastasized MC-BMT ( P < 0.05 ) . The relative percentage of CD4+ T-cells was significantly greater in metastasized tumors ( both MC-BMT and MC ) , ( P < 0.05 ) while the proportion of CD8+ T-cells was higher in MC-BMT without metastasis . Consequently , the CD4+/CD8+ ratio was significantly increased in both groups with metastasis . Regardless of the tumor type , the animals with high proportions of CD4+ and low CD8+ T-cells had decreased survival rates . CONCLUSION The intensity of lymphocytic infiltrate and probably the relative abundance of the CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes may represent important survival prognostic biomarkers for canine mammary carcinomas .
BACKGROUND Barrett's esophagus ( BE ) is caused by gastroesophageal reflux with consecutive mucosal inflammation , predisposing patients to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC ) . We investigated changes in T cell-related mucosal combinatorial molecular protein patterns in both diseases using the novel Multi-Epitope-Ligand-Cartography , a unique robotic whole-cell imaging technology that simultaneously visualizes dozens of proteins in structurally intact tissues and correlates cellular localization of proteins with function . RESULTS Biopsies were taken during endoscopy from BE , EAC , and normal control tissue , and proteomic microscopy was performed on 32 different epitopes . When the significance level was set to p < 0.0005 and the search depth to five antibody combinations , controls and BE can be differentiated by 63 , controls and EAC by 3222 , and BE from EAC by 1521 distinct protein combinations.For example , the number of activated apoptotic naive and memory T cells was significantly increased only in BE , whereas the number of activated apoptotic helper and regulatory T cells was significantly elevated in BE and EAC . In contrast , the number of activated apoptotic cytotoxic T cells was significantly elevated only in EAC . Confirming different pathways in BE and EAC , the number of T lymphocytes with p53 expression and downregulation of bcl2 expression ( CD3+p53+Bcl2-NfkB- ) was significantly increased in EAC compared to BE and controls . Interestingly , the number of precursor T cells ( CD7+ ) was significantly elevated only in EAC . These cells lack Bax and caspase-8 , suggesting impaired apoptosis in the early stages of T cell differentiation . CONCLUSION Proteomic analysis showed for the first time that proteins , which are critically involved in the mucosal immune system of the esophagus , are distinctly expressed in BE and EAC , whereas others are comparably altered in both diseases , suggesting that many pathogenic events might be shared by both diseases . Topological proteomic analysis , therefore , helps us to understand the different pathogenic events in the underlying disease pathways .
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase ( IDO ) is generally considered to be immunosuppressive but recent findings suggest this characterization oversimplifies its role in disease pathogenesis . Recently , we showed that IDO is essential for tumor outgrowth in the classical two-stage model of inflammatory skin carcinogenesis . Here , we report that IDO loss did not exacerbate classical inflammatory responses . Rather , IDO induction could be elicited by environmental signals and tumor promoters as an integral component of the inflammatory tissue microenvironment even in the absence of cancer . IDO loss had limited impact on tumor outgrowth in carcinogenesis models that lacked an explicit inflammatory tumor promoter . In the context of inflammatory carcinogenesis where IDO was critical to tumor development , the most important source of IDO was radiation-resistant non-hematopoietic cells , consistent with evidence that loss of the IDO regulatory tumor suppressor gene Bin1 in transformed skin cells facilitates IDO-mediated immune escape by a cell autonomous mechanism . Taken together , our results identify IDO as an integral component of ' cancer-associated ' inflammation that tilts the immune system toward tumor support . More generally , they promote the concept that mediators of immune escape and cancer-associated inflammation may be genetically synonymous .
The main objective of the present investigation was to study the urinary neopterin excretion in the context of the activation of the adaptive cellular immune system at the tumor site . For this purpose , we compared pre-treatment urinary neopterin levels measured in 92 ovarian cancer patients , with intratumoral levels of mRNA transcripts from factors either involved in the adaptive antitumor immune defense ( CD3 , IFN-gamma , IRF-1 , IRF-2 , SOCS1 and iNOS ) or immune tolerance ( FoxP3 ) . This study did not reveal an association between urinary neopterin and one of these investigated " on tumor site transcripts " . From all the factors reflecting the magnitude of the local adaptive antitumor response , intratumoral IRF-1 expression above the edge of the 25th percentile was found to predict most reliably favorable progression-free ( median 34 months vs. 10 months ; p < 0.001 ) and overall ( median 52 months vs. 16 months ; p < 0.001 ) survival . In contrast , pre-treatment urinary neopterin excretion above 275 mumol/mol creatinine , which indicates an unspecific activation of the innate immune system , was associated with a very poor overall survival with a median of only 11 months when compared with a median overall survival of 40 months in patients with lower urinary neopterin excretion ( p = 0.021 ) . Interestingly , the considerable survival benefit in patients with high IRF-1-expressing cancers was completely abrogated as well for progression-free as for overall survival when urinary neopterin concentrations were found to be concomitantly elevated . These findings demonstrate that in ovarian carcinomas the unspecific " cancer-related inflammation " contributes to a significant subversion of the adaptive antitumor immune defense mounted at the tumor site .
PURPOSE Idarubicin is a synthetic anthracycline anticancer drug widely used in the treatment of some hematological malignancies . The studies in our laboratory have clearly demonstrated that idarubicin can undergo reductive bioactivation by NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase to free radicals with resulting formation of DNA strand breaks , which can potentially contribute to its genotoxic effects [ Celik , H. , Arinc , E. , Bioreduction of idarubicin and formation of ROS responsible for DNA cleavage by NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and its potential role in the antitumor effect . J Pharm Pharm Sci , 11(4):68-82 , 2008 ] . In the current study , our aim was to investigate the possible protective effects of several phenolic antioxidants , quercetin , rutin , naringenin , resveratrol and trolox , against the DNA-damaging effect of idarubicin originating from its P450 reductase-catalyzed bioactivation . METHODS DNA damage was measured by detecting single-strand breaks in plasmid pBR322 DNA using a cell-free agarose gel method . RESULTS Our results indicated that , among the compounds tested , quercetin was the most potent antioxidant in preventing DNA damage . Quercetin significantly decreased the extent of DNA strand breaks in a dose-dependent manner ; 100 microM of quercetin almost completely inhibited the DNA strand breakage . Unlike quercetin , its glycosidated conjugate rutin , failed to provide any significant protection against idarubicin-induced DNA strand breaks except at the highest concentration tested ( 2 mM ) . The protective effects of other antioxidants were significantly less than that of quercetin even at high concentrations . Quercetin was found to be also an effective protector against DNA damage induced by mitomycin C. CONCLUSION We conclude that quercetin , one of the most abundant flavonoids in the human diet , is highly effective in reducing the DNA damage caused by the antitumor agents , idarubicin and mitomycin C , following bioactivation by P450 reductase .
Ultraviolet ( UV ) light induces DNA-damage checkpoints and mutagenesis , which are involved in cancer protection and tumorigenesis , respectively . How cells identify DNA lesions and convert them to checkpoint-activating structures is a major question . We show that during repair of UV lesions in noncycling cells , Exo1-mediated processing of nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) intermediates competes with repair DNA synthesis . Impediments of the refilling reaction allow Exo1 to generate extended ssDNA gaps , detectable by electron microscopy , which drive Mec1 kinase activation and will be refilled by long-patch repair synthesis , as shown by DNA combing . We provide evidence that this mechanism maybe stimulated by closely opposing UV lesions , represents a strategy to redirect problematic repair intermediates to alternative repair pathways , and may also be extended to physically different DNA damages . Our work has significant implications for understanding the coordination between repair of DNA lesions and checkpoint pathways to preserve genome stability .
SET and MYND domain-containing protein 3 ( SMYD3 ) is a histone methyltransferase that plays an important role in transcriptional regulation in human carcinogenesis . It can specifically methylate histone H3 at lysine 4 and activate the transcription of a set of downstream genes , including several oncogenes ( e.g. , N-myc , CrkL , Wnt10b , RIZ and hTERT ) and genes involved in the control of cell cycle ( e.g. , CyclinG1 and CDK2 ) and signal transduction ( e.g. , STAT1 , MAP3K11 and PIK3CB ) . To determine the effects of SMYD3 over-expression on cell proliferation , we transfected SMYD3 into MDA-MB-231 cells and found that these cells showed several transformed phenotypes as demonstrated by colony growth in soft agar . Besides , we show here that down-regulation of SMYD3 could induce G1-phase cell cycle arrest , indicating the potent induction of apoptosis by SMYD3 knockdown . These results suggest the regulatory mechanisms of SMYD3 on the acceleration of cell cycle and facilitate the development of strategies that may inhibit the progression of cell cycle in breast cancer cells .
Landmark studies of the status of DNA damage checkpoints and associated repair functions in preneoplastic and neoplastic cells has focused attention on importance of these pathways in cancer development , and inhibitors of repair pathways are in clinical trials for treatment of triple negative breast cancer . Cancer heterogeneity suggests that specific cancer subtypes will have distinct mechanisms of DNA damage survival , dependent on biological context . In this study , status of DNA damage response ( DDR)-associated proteins was examined in breast cancer subtypes in association with clinical features ; 479 breast cancers were examined for expression of DDR proteins gammaH2AX , BRCA1 , pChk2 , and p53 , DNA damage-sensitive tumor suppressors Fhit and Wwox , and Wwox-interacting proteins Ap2alpha , Ap2gamma , ErbB4 , and correlations among proteins , tumor subtypes , and clinical features were assessed . In a multivariable model , triple negative cancers showed significantly reduced Fhit and Wwox , increased p53 and Ap2gamma protein expression , and were significantly more likely than other subtype tumors to exhibit aberrant expression of two or more DDR-associated proteins . Disease-free survival was associated with subtype , Fhit and membrane ErbB4 expression level and aberrant expression of multiple DDR-associated proteins . These results suggest that definition of specific DNA repair and checkpoint defects in subgroups of triple negative cancer might identify new treatment targets . Expression of Wwox and its interactor , ErbB4 , was highly significantly reduced in metastatic tissues vs. matched primary tissues , suggesting that Wwox signal pathway loss contributes to lymph node metastasis , perhaps by allowing survival of tumor cells that have detached from basement membranes , as proposed for the role of Wwox in ovarian cancer spread .
Recently , we identified the " apoptotic ring, " containing phosphorylated histone H2AX ( gamma-H2AX ) , as an early chromatin modification during apoptosis . Because gamma-H2AX initiates the DNA damage response ( DDR ) , we tested whether the apoptotic H2AX response leads to the full recruitment of the DDR factors that normally coordinate DNA repair and cell-cycle checkpoints . We show that the apoptotic H2AX response does not recruit the DDR factors because MDC1 ( mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 ) , which normally binds to gamma-H2AX in response to DNA damage and amplifies the DDR , is cleaved by caspase-3 . This cleavage separates the BRCT and FHA domains of MDC1 and constitutes a novel mechanism for the inactivation of DNA repair in apoptotic cells . Also , we show that downregulation of MDC1 increases the apoptotic response to TRAIL . Together , these results implicate MDC1 in the cellular apoptotic response .
Maintenance of genomic integrity is essential for adult tissue homeostasis and defects in the DNA-damage response ( DDR ) machinery are linked to numerous pathologies including cancer . Here , we present evidence that the DDR exerts tumor suppressor activity in gliomas . We show that genes encoding components of the DDR pathway are frequently altered in human gliomas and that loss of elements of the ATM/Chk2/p53 cascade accelerates tumor formation in a glioma mouse model . We demonstrate that Chk2 is required for glioma response to ionizing radiation in vivo and is necessary for DNA-damage checkpoints in the neuronal stem cell compartment . Finally , we observed that the DDR is constitutively activated in a subset of human GBMs , and such activation correlates with regions of hypoxia .
DNA damage checkpoints in the cell cycle may be important barriers against cancer progression in human cells . Fanconi anemia ( FA ) is an inherited DNA instability disorder that is associated with bone marrow failure and a strong predisposition to cancer . Although FA cells experience constitutive chromosomal breaks , cell cycle arrest at the G2 DNA damage checkpoint , and an excess of cell death , some patients do become clinically stable , and the mechanisms underlying this , other than spontaneous reversion of the disease-causing mutation , are not well understood . Here we have defined a clonal phenotype , termed attenuation , in which FA patients acquire an abrogation of the G2 checkpoint arrest . Attenuated cells expressed lower levels of CHK1 ( also known as CHEK1 ) and p53 . The attenuation could be recapitulated by modulating the ATR/CHK1 pathway , and CHK1 inhibition protected FA cells from cell death . FA patients who expressed the attenuated phenotype had mild bone marrow deficiency and reached adulthood , but several of them eventually developed myelodysplasia or leukemia . Better understanding of attenuation might help predict a patient's clinical course and guide choice of treatment . Our results also highlight the importance of evaluating the cellular DNA damage checkpoint and repair pathways in cancer therapies in general .
Isolinderanolide B ( IOB ) , a butanolide extracted from the stems of Cinnamomum subavenium , was investigated for its antiproliferative activity in T24 human bladder cancer cells . To identity the anticancer mechanism of IOB , its effect on apoptosis , cell cycle distribution , and levels of p53 , p21 Waf1/Cip1 , Fas/APO-1 receptor , and Fas ligand was assayed . Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the G0/G1 phase arrest is because of increase in the expression of p21 Waf1/Cip1 . An enhancement in Fas/APO-1 and membrane-bound Fas ligand ( mFasL ) might be responsible for the apoptotic effect induced by IOB . This study reports the novel finding that the induction of p21 Waf1/Cip1 and activity of the Fas/mFas ligand apoptotic system may participate in the antiproliferative activity of IOB in T24 cells .
By using the rat azoxymethane ( AOM)-induced colon carcinogenesis model , which mirrors many clinical features of human colorectal cancer , we examined whether genetic changes occurring early in colonic mucosa are predictive of treatment efficacy . In the present study the administration of the chemopreventive agent lupulone over the course of 7 weeks postinitiation reduced the number of preneoplastic lesions in the colonic mucosa by 50% . At the molecular level we observed the downregulation of genes involved in the inflammatory response , including IL-1beta and TNF-alpha , and of matrix metalloproteinase-7 gene and protein expression . We also observed a substantial upregulation of components of the innate immune system , alpha-defensin-5 and lipocalin 2 . Lupulone induced the expression of apoptosis-related genes and caused a reversal of the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 ( Bcl-2 ; antiapoptotic ) to Bcl-2 associated X protein ( Bax ; proapoptotic ) transcript and protein ratios ( Bcl-2/Bax > 1 in AOM controls and Bcl-2/Bax < 1 in lupulone-treated AOM rats ) . Here , we identify several target genes that could be considered early biomarkers of colon carcinogenesis and indicative of drug efficacy .
