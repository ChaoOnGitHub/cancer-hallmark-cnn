RAD51 is a key enzyme of homologous recombination and repair of DNA double-strand breaks . RAD51 mRNA expression levels are significantly increased in laser-microdissected mammary simple carcinomas and their lymph node metastases when compared to adenomas or nonneoplastic mammary gland of the same dog . Here , RAD51 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded mammary carcinomas and their lymph node metastases of 40 dogs , adenomas of 48 dogs , and nonneoplastic mammary gland of 88 dogs . Number of cells with nuclear RAD51 expression was significantly ( P < or = .05 ) increased in carcinomas when compared to adenomas and metastases . In contrast , no significant differences in the number of RAD51-expressing cells were detected when metastases were compared with adenomas and nonneoplastic gland . RAD51 expression in carcinomas was correlated with expression in metastases but not with histologic grade . In conclusion , the increased number of RAD51-expressing cells in carcinomas might indicate genomic instability in these cells . Nevertheless , the increased RAD51 mRNA expression in metastases could not be confirmed by immunohistochemistry .
ATM(Tel1) and ATR(Rad3) checkpoint kinases phosphorylate the C-terminus of histone H2AX ( H2A in yeasts ) in chromatin flanking DNA damage , establishing a recruitment platform for checkpoint and repair proteins . Phospho-H2A/X ( gammaH2A/X)-binding proteins at double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) have been characterized , but those required for replication stress responses are unknown . Here , we present genetic , biochemical , small angle X-ray scattering ( SAXS ) , and X-ray structural studies of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Brc1 , a 6-BRCT-domain protein that is structurally related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rtt107 and mammalian PTIP . Brc1 binds gammaH2A to form spontaneous and DNA damage-induced nuclear foci . Spontaneous Brc1 foci colocalize with ribosomal DNA repeats , a region prone to fork pausing and genomic instability , whereas DNA damage-induced Brc1 foci colocalize with DSB response factors. gammaH2A binding is critical for Brc1 function . The 1.45 A resolution crystal structure of Brc1-gammaH2A complex shows how variable BRCT insertion loops sculpt tandem-BRCT phosphoprotein-binding pockets to facilitate unique phosphoprotein-interaction specificities , and unveils an acidic DNA-mimicking Brc1 surface . From these results , Brc1 docking to gammaH2A emerges as a critical chromatin-specific response to replication-associated DNA damage .
Multivitamin preparation ( MVP ) is part of total parenteral nutrition given to premature infants . Photoactivated MVP carries an important load in peroxides , but their cellular effects have not yet been determined . We hypothesized that these peroxides may elicit a DNA-damage response . We found that photoactivation of MVP and the resulting peroxide production were time-dependent and required the simultaneous presence of ascorbic acid and riboflavin . Cells treated with photoactivated MVP showed strongly stimulated poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation , an early DNA-damage response in mammals . Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation stimulation was dependent on the presence of ascorbic acid and riboflavin in the photoactivated MVP . It did not occur in the presence of a specific PARP inhibitor nor in mouse fibroblasts deficient in PARP-1 . Photoactivated MVP was able to induce single- and double-strand breaks in DNA , with a predominance of single-stand breaks . The presence of double-strand breaks was further confirmed using a 53PB1 focus analysis . Finally , photoactivated MVP was shown to be toxic to human cells and induced caspase-independent cell death . These results suggest that photoactivated MVP carries an important toxic load able to damage DNA and induce cell death . This study also emphasizes the importance of protecting MVP solution from light before use in preterm infants .
It is thought that high linear energy transfer ( LET ) radiation induces more complex DNA damage than low-LET particles , specifically clustered DNA damage that causes cells to repair DNA double strand breaks ( DSB ) more slowly and leads to severe biological consequences . The present study aimed to investigate the role of exogenously added glutathione ( GSH ) on ( 12)C-beam ( 287keV/mum ) and ( 7)Li-beam ( 60keV/mum ) induced chromosome aberration ( CA ) formation , particularly on exchange aberration formation . In order to characterize the role of GSH in the joining of DNA DSBs , we induced DNA lesions with bleomycin ( Blem ) in conjunction with either high- or low-LET radiation ( X-rays ) since the chemistry of the free DNA ends created by Blem and X-rays is similar . CHO cells were exposed to reduced GSH at a concentration of 2mM for 3h before radiation . Treatment with Blem ( 20mug/ml ) was carried out for 2h before the cells were exposed to radiation . Our results show that the frequency of chromosomal aberration increases with increased LET . Heavy ion exposed cells show a higher frequency of CA over time than do X-irradiated cells . An analysis of the first post-irradiation mitosis of exposed CHO cells shows that high-LET radiation induces more breaks than exchange-type aberrations and exogenous GSH has no influence on high-LET radiation-induced DNA damage . The DNA lesions induced by low-LET radiation interact relatively strongly with Blem-induced lesions whereas interaction between Blem and high-LET radiations was poor . This could be attributed to differences in repair kinetics and qualitative differences in the DNA lesions induced by Blem and high-LET radiation .
Homologous recombination ( HR ) is essential for repair of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) . Although the mechanisms of RAD-51-DNA filament assembly and strand exchange are well characterized , the subsequent steps of HR are less well defined . Here , we describe a synthetic lethal interaction between the C. elegans helicase helq-1 and RAD-51 paralog rfs-1 , which results in a block to meiotic DSB repair after strand invasion . Whereas RAD-51-ssDNA filaments assemble at meiotic DSBs with normal kinetics in helq-1 , rfs-1 double mutants , persistence of RAD-51 foci and genetic interactions with rtel-1 suggest a failure to disassemble RAD-51 from strand invasion intermediates . Indeed , purified HELQ-1 and RFS-1 independently bind to and promote the disassembly of RAD-51 from double-stranded , but not single-stranded , DNA filaments via distinct mechanisms in vitro . These results indicate that two compensating activities are required to promote postsynaptic RAD-51 filament disassembly , which are collectively essential for completion of meiotic DSB repair .
DNA double strand breaks ( DSBs ) arise from spontaneous DNA damage due to metabolic activities or from direct and indirect damaging effects of stress . DSBs are also formed transiently during such processes as replication , transcription , and DNA repair . The level of DSBs positively correlates with the activities of homologous and nonhomologous DNA repair pathways , which in turn inversely correlate with methylation levels and chromatin structure . Thus , measurement of strand breaks can provide an informative picture of genome stability of a given cell . The use of random oligonucleotide-primed synthesis for the analysis of DSB levels is described . Applications of the assay for quantitative detection of 3'OH , 3'P , or DNA strand breaks at a cleavage site of the deoxyribose residue are discussed .
