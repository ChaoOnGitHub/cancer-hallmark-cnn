Nucling is a stress-inducible protein associated with apoptosomes . The cytochrome c-triggered formation of apoptosomes represents a key-initiating event in apoptosis . We have recently reported that Nucling regulates the apoptotic pathway by controlling the activation of NF-kappaB as well . Here we show that hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) arising spontaneously against a background of hepatitis occurred more frequently in Nucling-knockout ( KO ) mice than wild-type ( WT ) mice . Biochemical serum testing revealed potential liver dysfunction with hypercholesterolemia in Nucling-KO males . In the background of Nucling-KO mice , we observed the up-regulation of TNFalpha , spontaneous NF-kappaB-activation and the induction of galectin-3 expression in liver . In addition , we observed a decrease in the number of Kupffer cells ( KCs ) in the KO mice . KCs are important for the hepatic immune system , acting as phagocytes or antigen-presenting cells ( APCs ) . We found that KCs in Nucling-KO mice were apoptotic possibly through the up-regulation of TNFalpha . These observations indicate that Nucling is important for the regulation of NF-kappaB signals in liver . We propose that Nucling deficiency could be a powerful tool to reveal the NF-kappaB-related molecular networks leading to hepatitis and HCC development .
We studied the effect of the immune system on two differentially aggressive melanomas developing in mice on conditional deletion of the INK4A/ARF tumor suppressor gene , with concomitant expression of oncogene H-Ras(G12V) and a natural cancer-germline tumor antigen ( TA ) . " Slow progressor " melanomas contained no activated T lymphocytes ( TL ) . In contrast , " aggressive " melanomas were infiltrated by activated TLs lacking effector molecules and expressing high levels of PD-1 , indicating an exhausted phenotype . Aggressive melanomas were also infiltrated by immature myeloid cells ( IMC ) . Infiltration was associated with local inflammation and systemic Th2/Th17-oriented chronic inflammation that seemed to impair further activation of TLs , as tumor-specific T cells adoptively transferred into mice bearing aggressive melanomas were poorly activated and failed to infiltrate the melanoma . This immunosuppression also led to the incapacity of these mice to reject inoculated TA-positive tumors , in contrast to slow-progressing melanoma-bearing mice , which were responsive . To test the role of adaptive immunity in tumor progression , we induced melanomas in immunodeficient RagKO compound mice . These mice developed aggressive but not slow-progressing melanomas at a higher frequency and with a shorter latency than immunocompetent mice . Immunodeficient mice also developed abnormal inflammation and infiltration of IMCs in a manner similar to immunocompetent mice , indicating that this phenotype was not dependent on adaptive immunity . Therefore , tumor-intrinsic factors distinguishing the two melanoma types control the initiation of inflammation , which was independent of adaptive immunity . The latter delayed development of aggressive melanomas but was overridden by inflammation .
