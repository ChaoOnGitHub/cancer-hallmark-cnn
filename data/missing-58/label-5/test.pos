Designed from a high throughput screened hit compound , novel 2-amino-1-thiazolyl imidazoles were synthesized and demonstrated cytotoxicity against human cancer cells. 1-(4-Phenylthiazol-2-yl)-4-(thiophen-2-yl)-1H-imidazol-2-amine ( compound 2 ) , a 2-amino-1-thiazolyl imidazole , inhibited tubulin polymerization , interacted with the colchicine-binding sites of tubulins , and caused cell cycle arrest at the G(2)/M phase in human gastric cancer cells . Disruption of the microtubule structure in cancer cells by compound 2 was also observed . Compound 2 concentration-dependently inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells in histocultured human gastric and colorectal tumors . Given orally , compound 2 prolonged the lifespans of leukemia mice intraperitoneally inoculated with the murine P388 leukemic cells . We report 2-amino-1-thiazolyl imidazoles as a novel class of orally active microtubule-destabilizing anticancer agents .
The aim of this study was to determine whether caffeine enhanced radiosensitivity of normal liver tissue in a rat radiation-induced liver disease model . Buffalo rat McA-RH7777 hepatocellular cancer cells and BRL3A normal liver cells were irradiated , and cell cycle distribution and apoptosis rates were analyzed . A rat model of radiation-induced liver disease was established , rats were randomized into four groups : control ; caffeine alone ; irradiation ( IR ) alone ; and caffeine plus IR ( Caff + IR ) group . Apoptosis rates in normal rat liver tissue after IR were evaluated by TUNEL staining and caspase-3 Western blot . Transaminase activity was measured and histopathological examination was done after IR . Caffeine abrogated IR-induced G2 phase arrest ( Caff + IR vs. IR : 40.9 +/- 4.0 vs. 60.7 +/- 5.5% , at 12 h after IR ) and increased apoptosis rates ( Caff + IR vs. IR : 56.1 +/- 6.8 vs. 35.5 +/- 4.0% , at 72 h after IR ) in McA-RH7777 cells , but did not affect IR-induced G2 phase arrest and apoptosis rates at any time point after IR in BRL3A cells . Caffeine did not enhance apoptosis , transaminase activity , or histopathological injury of normal rat liver tissue at any time points after IR . This study suggests that caffeine might not enhance radiosensitivity of normal liver tissue in vivo . In an earlier study , we reported that caffeine enhanced radiosensitivity of human hepatocellular cancer in a nude mice model . Together , these results offer feasibility of clinical application .
