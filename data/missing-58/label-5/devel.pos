During tumorigenesis , cells acquire immortality in association with the development of genomic instability . However , it is still elusive how genomic instability spontaneously generates during the process of tumorigenesis . Here , we show that precancerous DNA lesions induced by oncogene acceleration , which induce situations identical to the initial stages of cancer development , trigger tetraploidy/aneuploidy generation in association with mitotic aberration . Although oncogene acceleration primarily induces DNA replication stress and the resulting lesions in the S phase , these lesions are carried over into the M phase and cause cytokinesis failure and genomic instability . Unlike directly induced DNA double-strand breaks , DNA replication stress-associated lesions are cryptogenic and pass through cell-cycle checkpoints due to limited and ineffective activation of checkpoint factors . Furthermore , since damaged M-phase cells still progress in mitotic steps , these cells result in chromosomal mis-segregation , cytokinesis failure and the resulting tetraploidy generation . Thus , our results reveal a process of genomic instability generation triggered by precancerous DNA replication stress .
The aim of this study was to determine whether isorhamnetin , an immediate 3'-O-methylated metabolite of quercetin , affects proliferation , cell death , and the cell cycle of human colon carcinoma ( HCT-116 ) cells . Isorhamnetin was found to be a potent antiproliferative agent in a dose- and time-dependent manner , with an IC50 of 72 muM after 48 h of incubation as estimated by MTT assay . Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy analysis showed that isorhamnetin exerted a stimulatory effect on apoptosis and necrosis . Isorhamnetin also increased the number of cells in G2/M phase . Serum deprivation appeared to potentiate the effects of isorhamnetin on cell death and facilitated cell cycle progression to G0/G1 phase . These results suggest that isorhamnetin might mediate inhibition of HCT-116 cell growth through the perturbation of cell cycle progression and are consistent with the notion that G2/M checkpoints could be a conserved target for flavonoids in human colon cancer cells , leading to apoptotic and necrotic death . These antiproliferative , apoptotic , necrotic , and cell cycle effects suggest that isorhamnetin may have clinically significant therapeutic and chemopreventive capabilities . To our knowledge , this is the first report of the effect of isorhamnetin on human colon cancer cells .
