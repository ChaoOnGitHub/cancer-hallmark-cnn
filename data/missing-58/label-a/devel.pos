BACKGROUND & AIMS Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is an aggressive malignancy with few treatment options . As the status of the tumour immune microenvironment can affect progression of established tumours , we evaluated potential immune mechanisms associated with survival in HCC . METHODS Immune gene expression profiles were analyzed in tumour and non-tumour liver tissues from resected HCC patients using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry . Tumour-infiltrating leukocytes ( TILs ) were isolated to verify the expression of immune genes and to identify proliferating TILs . These parameters were analyzed statistically in relation with patient survival and tumour phenotype ( apoptosis and proliferation ) . RESULTS The immune microenvironment within tumours was found to be heterogeneous , although globally more inert compared to the adjacent non-tumour liver tissue . Univariate analysis in 61 patients identified a group of innate immune genes whose expression within tumours is positively associated with patient survival . TNF , IL6 and CCL2 are the most significant genes , with TNF being an independent predictor of survival in multivariate analysis . The gene set includes macrophage and NK-associated molecules such as TLR4 , TLR3 , CCR2 , NCR3 . Most of these molecules are expressed by TILs . Importantly , proliferating immune cells , predominantly NK and T cells , are present in tumours of patients with longer survival , and exclusively in areas devoid of proliferating tumour cells . NK and CD8(+) T cell densities are correlated positively with tumour apoptosis , and negatively with tumour proliferation . CONCLUSIONS Hence , an inflammatory immune microenvironment within HCC tumours could be an important means to control tumour progression via TIL activation and proliferation .
A fully intact immune system would be expected to hinder the efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy by inhibiting viral replication . Simultaneously , however , it may also enhance antitumor therapy through initiation of proinflammatory , antiviral cytokine responses at the tumor site . The aim of this study was to investigate the role of a fully intact immune system on the antitumor efficacy of an oncolytic virus . In this respect , injection of oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) into subcutaneous B16ova melanomas in C57Bl/6 mice leads to tumor regression , but it is not associated with viral replicative burst in the tumor . In contrast , intratumoral delivery of VSV induces an acute proinflammatory reaction , which quickly resolves concomitantly with virus clearance . Consistent with the hypothesis that therapy may not be dependent on the ability of VSV to undergo progressive rounds of replication , a single-cycle VSV is equally effective as a fully replication-competent VSV , whereas inactivated viruses do not generate therapy . Even though therapy is dependent on host CD8+ and natural killer cells , these effects are not associated with interferon-gamma-dependent responses against either the virus or tumor . There is , however , a strong correlation between viral gene expression , induction of proinflammatory reaction in the tumor and in vivo therapy . Overall , our results suggest that acute innate antiviral immune response , which rapidly clears VSV from B16ova tumors , is associated with the therapy observed in this model . Therefore , the antiviral immune response to an oncolytic virus mediates an intricate balance between safety , restriction of oncolysis and , potentially , significant immune-mediated antitumor therapy .
