BACKGROUND Dendritic cells ( DCs ) isolated from tumor bearing animals or from individuals with solid tumors display functional abnormalities and the DC impairment has emerged as one mechanism for tumor evasion from the control of the immune system . Ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) , the most common pancreatic cancer , is recognized as a very aggressive cancer type with a mortality that almost matches the rate of incidence . METHODS We examined the systemic influence ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) exerted on levels of peripheral blood DCs and inflammatory mediators in comparison to the effects exerted by other pancreatic tumors , chronic pancreatitis , and age-matched controls . RESULTS All groups examined , including PDAC , had decreased levels of myeloid DCs ( MDC ) and plasmacytoid DCs ( PDC ) and enhanced apoptosis in these cells as compared to controls . We found elevated levels of PGE2 and CXCL8 in subjects with PDAC , and chronic pancreatitis . Levels of these inflammatory factors were in part restored in PDAC after tumor resection , whereas the levels of DCs were impaired in the majority of these patients approximately 12 weeks after tumor removal . Our results prove that solid pancreatic tumors , including PDAC , systemically affect blood DCs . The impairments do not seem to be tumor-specific , since similar results were obtained in subjects with chronic pancreatitis . Furthermore , we found that PDAC patients with a survival over 2 years had significant higher levels of blood DCs compared to patients with less than one year survival . CONCLUSIONS Our findings points to the involvement of inflammation in the destruction of the blood MDCs and PDCs . Furthermore , the preservation of the blood DCs compartment in PDAC patients seems to benefit their ability to control the disease and survival .
We studied the effect of the immune system on two differentially aggressive melanomas developing in mice on conditional deletion of the INK4A/ARF tumor suppressor gene , with concomitant expression of oncogene H-Ras(G12V) and a natural cancer-germline tumor antigen ( TA ) . " Slow progressor " melanomas contained no activated T lymphocytes ( TL ) . In contrast , " aggressive " melanomas were infiltrated by activated TLs lacking effector molecules and expressing high levels of PD-1 , indicating an exhausted phenotype . Aggressive melanomas were also infiltrated by immature myeloid cells ( IMC ) . Infiltration was associated with local inflammation and systemic Th2/Th17-oriented chronic inflammation that seemed to impair further activation of TLs , as tumor-specific T cells adoptively transferred into mice bearing aggressive melanomas were poorly activated and failed to infiltrate the melanoma . This immunosuppression also led to the incapacity of these mice to reject inoculated TA-positive tumors , in contrast to slow-progressing melanoma-bearing mice , which were responsive . To test the role of adaptive immunity in tumor progression , we induced melanomas in immunodeficient RagKO compound mice . These mice developed aggressive but not slow-progressing melanomas at a higher frequency and with a shorter latency than immunocompetent mice . Immunodeficient mice also developed abnormal inflammation and infiltration of IMCs in a manner similar to immunocompetent mice , indicating that this phenotype was not dependent on adaptive immunity . Therefore , tumor-intrinsic factors distinguishing the two melanoma types control the initiation of inflammation , which was independent of adaptive immunity . The latter delayed development of aggressive melanomas but was overridden by inflammation .
